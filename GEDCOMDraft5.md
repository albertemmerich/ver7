# <a name="Intro-0"></a>Introduction

GEDCOM was developed by the Family History Department of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to provide a flexible, uniform format for exchanging computerized genealogical data. GEDCOM is an acronym for <u>**GE**</u>nealogical <u>**D**</u>ata <u>**COM**</u>munication. Its purpose is to foster sharing genealogical information and to develop a wide range of inter-operable software products to assist genealogists, historians, and other researchers.

## <a name="Intro-1"></a>Purpose and Content of *The GEDCOM Standard*

*The GEDCOM Standard* is a technical document written for computer programmers, system developers, and technically sophisticated users.
This document describes GEDCOM as follows:

- GEDCOM container format (see [Chapter 1](#1-0))
- GEDCOM data types (see [Chapter 2](#2-0))
- GEDCOM genealogical structures (see [Chapter 3](#3-0))

Chapter 1 describes the lower level, known as the **GEDCOM container format**.
The GEDCOM container format is a general-purpose data representation language for representing any kind of structured information in a sequential medium,
similar to XML, JSON, YAML, SDLang, etc.
Chapter 1 discusses the syntax and identification of structured information in general,
but it does not deal with the semantic content of any particular kind of data.

Chapter 2 describes several **data types** used to represent genealogical information,
such as a date format that permits dating in multiple calendar systems.

Chapter 3 describes a set of nested **GEDCOM genealogical structures**.
This provides structures for representing
historical claims, such as individuals, families, and events;
sourcing information, such as sources, repositories, and citations;
and research metadata, such as information about researchers and rights.

> **Note**: Prior to GEDCOM 7, 
>
> - the GEDCOM container format was called the GEDCOM data format.
> - the GEDCOM data types were unnamed and described in various places throughout the document.
> - the GEDCOM genealogical structures were known as the Lineage-Linked GEDCOM Form.

## <a name="Intro-2"></a>Purpose for Version 7.x

There have been multiple prior releases of GEDCOM, with a somewhat idiosyncratic version numbering.
The first public comment draft was released in 1984.
The previous major version was 5.5.1 which was released in draft status in November 1999
and re-released as a standard in October 2019.

Version 7.0 has a number of goals, including

- Clarify ambiguities in the specification
- Simplify implementations by removing special-case handling
- Modernize character encoding, length restrictions, and specification wording
- Introduce semantic versioning (see <https://semver.org/>)
- Add standard support for common extensions in 5.5.1

GEDCOM 7.x introduces several breaking changes with GEDCOM 5.5.1;
GEDCOM 5.5.1 files are, in general, not valid GEDCOM 7.0 files and *vice versa*.
These breaking changes were necessary to remove complicated constructs left over from earlier GEDCOM versions.

## <a name="Intro-3"></a>Modifications in Version 7.0.0

Syntactic changes

- Remove all length restrictions across the board
- Only support UTF-8, not ANSEL or UTF-16
- Recommend Byte-Order Mark
- "@" is only special at beginning and end of payloads, where it gets doubled. No more escapes
- Remove all references to CONC
- Define that any payload with a newline uses CONT
- Remove references to colons, exclamation marks in pointers
- SUBM no longer required
- No tag in context has distinct pointer and string versions
- The Date structure is modified as follows:
    - Calendars as keywords, not escapes
    - Years may be any number of digits
    - B.C. now BCE, may have days and months, and is limited to Gregorian and Julian calendars
    - May always have TIME substructure
    - No more INT, date phrases, dual years; use PHRASE instead
- The Personal Name structure is modified as follows:
    - `NAME` has no payload
    - `PART` substructures have name parts in presentation order
    - `PART` substructures are joined with intermediate word separators in the target language
    - Previous name part tags (`GIVN`, `SURN`, etc) become `TYPE` payloads under `PART`
- The Age structure is modified as follows
    - no more age word; they become PHRASEs instead
- Prohibit leading whitespace (before the level) in a line
- Identify difference between "controlled line_value choices" and uncontrolled choices; restrict controlled choices to upper-case ASCII with no spaces; add PHRASE for uncontrolled extensions to controlled values across the board
- Define a GEDZIP file format

Clarifications

- Move toward more versatile families by stating HUSB/WIFE decoupled from SEX
- Assert it's EMAIL, not EMAI
- Remove all hints of space stripping; space is significant
- Allow PHON, EMAIL, FAX, WWW even if there is no ADDRESS_STRUCTURE
- Remove the suggestion of exceptions in the "preferred first"
- Clarify that "preferred first" allows expressing display information like their profile photo (first OBJE with an image type) and display name (first NAME)
- Require CONT to precede any other subtags (if present)
- Remove example where AGE is at level 1
- Remove incorrect advice that NAME_PIECE_* be comma-separated
- ADR/ADS: clarify that GEDCOM use in single-Adar years is counter-intuitive
- AGE: y is mandatory, spaces between components, ">" symbol means "at least" not "more than"
- DATE: add explicit examples showing all versions of how calendars work in two-date dates
- Clarify that ALIA names are inappropriate; should be NAME with TYPE AKA instead
- Remove example where an ASSO points to a SUBM instead of an INDI

- Remove HEAD.PLAC.FORM (no longer needed)
- Change FILE.FORM to have a media-type payload
- Change FILE to allow URL or local path
- Add CROP under OBJE
- Remove RIN; conversion should replace it with EXID TYPE Unknown

# <a name="1-0"></a> Chapter 1: GEDCOM container format

## Characters

Each GEDCOM transmission is a sequence of octets or bytes.
The octets encode a sequence of characters according to the UTF-8 character encoding as described in §9.2 of [ISO/IEC 10646].

The first character in each GEDCOM transmission *should* be U+FEFF, the byte-order mark.
If present, this initial character has no meaning within GEDCOM but serves to indicate to other systems that GEDCOM uses the UTF-8 character encoding.

Certain characters *must not* appear in any GEDCOM data:

- The C0 control characters other than tab and line endings (U+0000--U+001F except U+0009 U+000A and U+000D);
- The DEL character (U+007F);
- Surrogates (U+D800--U+DFFF);
- and invalid code points (U+FFFE and U+FFFF).

Implementations should be aware that bytes per character and characters per glyph are both variable when using UTF-8.
Use of Unicode-aware processing and display libraries is *recommended*.

Character-level GEDCOM grammar is specified in this document using
Augmented Bakaus-Naur Form (ABNF)
as defined in IETF STD 68 (<https://tools.ietf.org/html/std68>)
and modified in IETF RFC 7405 (<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7405>).
The banned characters can be expressed in ABNF as production `banned`:

```abnf
banned = %x00-08 / %x0B-0C / %x0E-1F ; C0 other than LF CR and Tab
       / %7F                         ; DEL
       / %xD800-DFFF                 ; Surrogates
       / %xFFFE-FFFF                 ; invalid
```

> **Question**: 5.5.1 banned U+007F (DEL) as well, but XML does not. Should 7.0? Should we also ban all C1 control characters (U+0080 through U+009F)?


All other ABNF expressions in this document assume the absence of any characters matching production `banned`.

This document additionally makes use of the following named character sets in ABNF:


```abnf
digit       = %x30-39   ; 0 through 9
nonzero     = %x31-39   ; 1 through 9
ucletter    = %x41-5A   ; A through Z
lcletter    = %x61-7A   ; a through z
underscore  = %x5F      ; _
hyphen      = %x2D      ; -
atsign      = %x40      ; @
space       = %x20
```

## Structures

A GEDCOM **structure** consists of a structure type, an optional **payload**, and a collection of substructures.
The payload belongs to one of several data types, as described in [Chapter 2](#2-0).

Every structure is either a **record**, meaning it is not contained in any other structure's collection of substructures;
or it is a **substructure** of exactly one other structure, called its **superstructure**.
Each substructure either refines the meaning of its superstructure, provides metadata about its superstructure, or introduce new data that is closely related to its superstructure.

The collection of substructures is partially ordered:
substructures with the same structure type are in a fixed order,
but substructures with different structure types may be reordered.
The order of substructures of a single type indicates user preference, with the first substructure being the most-preferred value,
unless a different meaning is explicitly indicated in the structure's definition.

A structure must have either a non-empty payload or at least one substructure.
Empty payloads and missing payloads are considered equivalent; the remainder of this document uses "payload" as shorthand for "non-empty payload".

A structure is a representation of data about its **subject**: the entity, event, claim, activity, etc. which the structure describes.

GEDCOM transmissions also contain three types of pseudo-structures:

- The header resembles a record, comes first in each transmission, and contains metadata about the entire transmission in its substructures.
    See [The Header](#the-header) for more.

- The trailer resembles a record, comes last in each transmission, and cannot contain substructures.

- A line continuation resembles a substructure, comes before any other substructures, is used to encode multi-line payloads, and cannot contain substructures.

Previous versions of GEDCOM limited the number of characters that could appear in a structure, record, and payload. Those restrictions were removed in GEDCOM 7.0.

## Lines

A GEDCOM **line** is a string representation of (part of) a GEDCOM *structure*.
A line consists of a level, optional cross-reference identifier, tag, optional line value, and line terminator.
It matches the production `Line`:

```abnf
Line    = Level D [Xref D] Tag [D LineVal] EOL

EOL     = %x0D [%x0A] / %x0A [%x0D]       ; CR and/or LF in any order
D       = space
Tag     = stdTag / extTag
Xref    = atsign 1*tagchar atsign         ; but not "@VOID@"
LineVal = pointer / lineStr
Level   = nonzero *digit

tagchar = ucletter / digit / underscore
extTag  = underscore 1*tagchar
stdTag  = ucletter 0*tagchar

Pointer = voidPtr / Xref
voidPtr = %s"@VOID@"

nonAt   = %x09 / %x20-3F / %x41-10FFFF    ; non-EOL, non-@
nonEOL  = %x09 / %x20-10FFFF              ; non-EOL
lineStr = (nonAt / atsign atsign) *nonEOL ; leading @ doubled
```

> **Question**: is `1*tagChar` the right middle production for `Xref`?


The **level** matches production `Level` and is used to encode substructure relationships.
Any line with level $0$ encodes a record or a record-like pseudo-structure.
Any line with level $x > 0$ greater encodes a substructure of the structure encoded by the nearest preceding line with level $x-1$.

The **cross-reference identifier** matches production `Xref` (but not `voidPtr`) and indicates that this is a structure to which pointer-type payloads may point.
Each cross-reference identifier must be unique within a given data transmission.
Cross-reference identifiers are not retained between transmissions and *should not* be made visible to the user to avoid them referring to transient data within notes or other durable data.

Any record *may* have a cross-reference identifier, even if no other structure points to it.
A substructure or pseudo-structure *must not* have a cross-reference identifier.

> **Note**: Future versions of GEDCOM may allow substructures to have cross-reference identifiers.

The **tag** matches production `Tag` and encodes the structure's type.
Tags that match the production `stdTag` are defined in this document;
tags that match `extTag` are defined according to [Extensions](#extensions).

The **line value** matches production `LineVal` and encodes the structure's payload.
Line value content is sufficient to distinguish between pointers and non-pointers.
Pointers are encoded as the cross-reference identifier of the pointed-to structure.
The exact encoding of non-pointer payloads is dependent on the datatype of the payload, as determined by the structure type.
The datatype of non-pointer payloads cannot be fully determined by line value content alone.

If a line value matches production `Xref`, the same value *must* occur as the cross-reference identifier of a structure within the transmission.
The special `voidPtr` production is provided to encode null pointers.

A leading `@` (U+0040) in a non-pointer payload *shall* be escaped in the corresponding line value by doubling the `@`.

> **Note**: Line values that match neither `Xref` nor `lineStr` are prohibited in this version of GEDCOM. They have been used in previous versions of GEDCOM (for example, a line value beginning `@#D` was a date in GEDCOM 4.0 through 5.5.1) and may be used again in a future version of GEDCOM if an appropriate need arises.

The components of a line are each separated by a single **delimiter** matching production `D`. A delimiter is always a single space character (U+0020). Using multiple delimiters between components of a line is prohibited. Thus if the tag is followed by two spaces, the first space is a delimiter and the second space is part of the line value.

All characters in a payload must be preserved in the corresponding line value, including preserving any leading or trailing spaces.

Each line is ended by a **line terminator** matching production `EOL`. A line terminator may be a carriage return U+000D, line feed U+000A, or one of each. The same line terminator *should* be used on every line of a given transmission.

Line values cannot contain internal line terminators, but some payloads can. If a payload contains a line terminator, the payload is split on the line terminators into several payloads. The first of these split payloads is encoded as the line value of the structure's line, and each subsequent split payload is encoded as the line value of a **line continuation** pseudo-structure of the structure.
The tag of a line continuation pseudo-structure is `CONT`.
The order of the line continuation pseudo-structures matches the order of the lines of text in the payload.

Line continuation pseudo-structures are not considered to be structures nor to be part of a structure's collection of substructures. They *must* appear immediately following the line whose payload they are encoding and before any other line.

Because line terminators in payloads are encoded using line continuations, it is not possible to distinguish between U+000D and U+000A in payloads.

Previous versions of GEDCOM limited the number of characters that could appear in a tag, cross-reference identifier, and line-value.
Those restrictions were removed in GEDCOM 7.0.
The `CONC` pseudo-structure, which allowed line values to have a shorter length restriction than payloads, was also removed.

Previous versions of GEDCOM allowed spaces, tabs, and line terminators to precede the level of a line.
That permission was removed from GEDCOM 7.0 to simplify parsing.

Previous versions of GEDCOM required doubling all `@` in a line value, but such doubling was not widely implemented in practice. Only initial `@` are doubled in GEDCOM 7.0.



### Examples:

The following are examples of valid but unrelated GEDCOM lines:

- level 0, cross-reference identifier `@I1234@`, tag `INDI`, no line value.

    ````gedcom
    0 @I1234@ INDI 
    ````

- level 1, no cross-reference identifier, tag `CHIL`, pointer line value pointing to a the structure with cross-reference identifier "`@I1234@`".

    ````gedcom
    1 CHIL @I1234@
    ````

- level 1, no cross-reference identifier, tag `NOTE`, and line value + continuation psuedo-structure to encode a two-line payload string, the first line being "`This is a note field that is`" and the second line being "`continued on the next line.`".

    ````gedcom
    1 NOTE This is a note field that is 
    2 CONT continued on the next line.
    ````


## <a name="the-header"></a> The Header and Trailer

Every GEDCOM transmission *must* begin with a Header pseudo-structure and end with a trailer pseudo-structure.

The trailer pseudo-structure has level `0`, tag `TRLR` and no line value or substructures.
The trailer has no semantic meaning; it is present only to mark the end of the GEDCOM transmission.

The header pseudo-structure has level `0`, tag `HEAD`, and no line value.
The substructures of the header pseudo-structure provide metadata about the entire GEDCOM transmission.
Some of those substructures are defined here;
others are defined in [Chapter 3](#3-0) or by extensions.

Every header must contain a substructure with a known tag that identifies the standard to which the GEDCOM transmission complies.
For the GEDCOM 7.0.0 genealogical structures, this is the `GEDC` structure described in [Chapter 3](#GEDC).

A header *should* contain an extension schema structure with tag `SCHMA`
as described in [Extensions](#extensions).

## <a name="extensions"></a> Extensions

Extensions to GEDCOM are allowed in the following ways:

- Standard [tag-defined structures](#tag-defined structures) may be used in non-standard locations provided their meaning and payload type is respected.
- Single-copy substructures may be given multiple instances, provided the semantics of the first follows the specification and the order matches the preference order rule.
- New structure types and enumeration values may be added provided they use extension tags.

Violations of these rules result in **prohibited extensions**.

### Extension Tags


An extension tag matches the `extTag` production.
Each extension tag shall be mapped to a URI using the schema structure;
those that are not so mapped are called **unsupported extensions** and *must not* be used.

The schema structure is a substructure of the header with tag `SCHMA`.
It should appear within the transmission before any extension tags.
The schema's substructures are tag definitions.

A tag definition is a structure with tag `TAG`.
Its payload is an extension tag, a space, and a URI
and defines that extension tag to be an abbreviation for that URI within the current transmission.
It is *required* that each tag definition's extension tag be unique within the transmission.
It is *recommended* that each URI also be unique.

For example, the following GEDCOM header

```gedcom
0 HEAD
1 SCHMA
2 TAG _SKYPEID http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/skypeID
2 TAG _MEMBER http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/member
2 TAG _INIT http://example.com/GEDCOM/Initiatory-ordinance
```

defines the following tags

| Tag   | Means |
| :---- | :---- |
| `_SKYPEID` | `http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/skypeID` |
| `_MEMBER` | `http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/member` |
| `_INIT` | `http://example.com/GEDCOM/Initiatory-ordinance` |

> **Question** should we split the tag and URI onto separate lines instead, as e.g.
>
> ```gedcom
> 2 TAG _SKYPEID
> 3 URI http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/skypeID
> ```

The meaning of an extension is identified by its URI, not its tag.
Extension tags are arbitrary and can be changed freely by modifying the schema.
Such change may be necessary when one products pick the same tags for their URIs that another product uses for different URIs.

Extension creators are encouraged to use URLs as their URIs
and to serve a page describing the meaning of an extension at its URL.
Future versions of GEDCOM may include additional recommendations relating to documentation, machine-readable documentation, and/or embedded metadata about extensions within the schema.

## Removing data

There may be situations where data needs to be removed from a GEDCOM transmission, such as when a user requests its deletion or marks it as confidential and not for export.

In general, removed data should result in removed structures.

Pointers to a removed structure should be replaced with `voidPtr`s.

If removal of a structure makes the superstructure invalid because the superstructure required the substructure, the structure should instead be retained and have its payload changed to a `voidPtr` if a pointer to a datatype-appropriate empty value otherwise.

If removing a structure leaves its superstructure with no payload and no substructures, the superstructure should also be removed.



# <a name="2-0"></a> Chapter 2: GEDCOM data types

Every line value (with any continuation pseudo-structures) is a string.
However, those strings can encode one of several conceptual datatypes.

## Text

A free-text string is text in a human language.
Conceptually, it may be either a user-generated string or a source-generated string.
Programmatically, both are treated as unconstrained sequences of characters with an associated language.

## Integer

An integer is a non-empty sequence of ASCII decimal digits
and represents a non-negative integer in base-10.
Leading zeros have no semantic meaning and *should* be omitted.

```abnf
Integer = 1*digit
```

Negative integers are not supported by GEDCOM.

## Enumeration

An enumeration is a selection from a set of options.
They are represented in GEDCOM as a string matching the same production as a tag, including the rules about extensions beginning with `_` (U+005F) and being mapped to URIs by a schema.

```abnf
Enum    = Tag
```

Each enumeration value has a distinct meaning,
as identified by its corresponding URI.

## Date

GEDCOM dates are a somewhat involved datatype, including the ability to store approximate dates, date periods, and dates expressed in different calendars.

Technically, there are three distinct date datatypes:
`DateValue` is a generic type that can express many kinds of dates;
`DateExact` is used for timestamps and other fully-known dates;
and `DatePeriod` is used to express time intervals that span multiple days.


```abnf
DateValue   = date / datePeriod / DateRange / dateApprox
DateExact   = day D month D year  ; in Gregorian calendar
DatePeriod  = %s"FROM" D date [D %s"TO" D date]
            / %s"TO" D date
DateRange   = %s"BET" D date D %s"AND" D date
            / %s"AFT" D date
            / %s"BEF" D date

date        = [calendar D] [[day D] month D] year [D epoch]
dateApprox  = (%s"ABT" / %s"CAL" / %s"EST") D date

calendar = %s"GREGORIAN" / %s"JULIAN" / %s"FRENCH_R" / %s"HEBREW"
         / extTag

day     = Integer
year    = Integer
month   = stdTag  ; but constrained by calendar
epoch   = %s"BCE" ; only permitted in some calendars
```

In addition to the constraints above,

- The allowable `month`s are determined by the `calendar`
- No calendar can define months `FROM`, `TO`, `BET`, `AND`, `BEF`, `AFT`, `ABT`, `CAL`, `EST`, or `BCE`.
- Not all calendars allow an `epoch` marker

An absent `calendar` is equivalent to the calendar `GREGORIAN`.

The grammar above allows for `date`s to be preceded by various words. The meaning of these words is given as follows:

Known calendars and tips for handling dual dating and extension calendars are given in [Appendix A: Calendars and Dates](#A-calendars)

Date payloads may also be omitted entirely if no suitable form is know but a substructure (such as a `PHRASE` or `TIME`) is desired.

## Time

Time is represented on a 24-hour clock (i.e., 23:00 not 11:00 PM).
It may be represented either in event-local time or in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
UTC is indicated by including a `Z` (U+005A) after the time value; event-local time is indicated by its absence.

```abnf
Time     =  hour ":" minute [":" second ["." fraction]] [%s"Z"]

hour     = digit / ("0" / "1") digit / "2" ("0" / "1" / "2" / "3")
minute   = ("0" / "1" / "2" / "3" / "4" / "5") digit
second   = ("0" / "1" / "2" / "3" / "4" / "5") digit
fraction = 1*digit
```

> **Note**: The above grammar prohibits end-of-day instant `24:00:00` and leap-seconds. It does allow both `02:50` and `2:50` as the same time.

## Age

Ages are represented by counts of years, months, weeks, and/or days, or by one of a small number of pre-defined terms.

```abnf
Age         = [ageBound D] ageDuration

ageBound    = "<" / ">"
ageDuration = years [D months] [D weeks] [D days]
            / months [D weeks] [D days]
            / weeks [D days]
            / days

years   = Integer %x79    ; 35y
months  = Integer %x6D    ; 11m
weeks   = Integer %x77    ; 8w
days    = Integer %x64    ; 21d
```

Where

|Production |Meaning                                           |
|:----------|:-------------------------------------------------|
|`<`        | The real age was less than the provided age      |
|`>`        | The real age was greater than the provided age   |
|`years`    | a number of years                                |
|`months`   | a number of months                               |
|`weeks`    | a number of weeks                                |
|`days`     | a number of days                                 |

Non-integer numbers should be rounded down to an integer. Thus, if someone has lived for 363.5 days, their age might be written as `363d`, `51w 6d`, `51w`, `0y`, etc.

Because numbers are rounded down, `>` effectively includes its endpoint; that is, the age `> 8d` includes people who have lived 8 days + a few seconds.

Different cultures count ages differently: some incrementing years on the anniversary of birth and others at particular seasons; some round to the nearest year, others round years down, others up. Because users may be unaware of these traditions or may fail to convert them to the round-down convention used in GEDCOM, errors in age of up to a year are common.

Age payloads may also be omitted entirely if no suitable form is know but a substructure (such as a `PHRASE`) is desired.

## Special

A string that is not intended to provide human-language information, but the constraints of which are either unique to that record type or are not simply expressed.
For example, the payload of a `IDNO` structure may obey different rules for each possible `TYPE` substructure.



# <a name="3-0"></a> Chapter 3: GEDCOM genealogical structures

## Introduction

This chapter describes a set of structure types for exchanging family-based lineage-linked genealogical information in the GEDCOM format.
Lineage-linked data pertains to individuals linked in family relationships across multiple generations.

The GEDCOM genealogical structures defined in this chapter are based on the general framework of the GEDCOM container format and GEDCOM data types defined in Chapters 1 and 2.

Historically, the GEDCOM genealogical structures were used as the only form approved for exchanging data with Ancestral File, TempleReady and other Family History resource files.
Those systems were all replaced between 1999 and 2019, and GEDCOM-X (<https://gedcomx.org>) was introduced as the new syntax for communicated with their replacements.
GEDCOM and GEDCOM-X have similar expressive power,
but as of 2020 GEDCOM is more common for exchanging single-researcher files between applications
and GEDCOM-X is more common for transferring bulk data and communicated directly between applications.

### Organization

The basic description of the GEDCOM genealogical structures's organization is presented in the following 3 major sections:

* "[Structure Organization]" describes records and other nested structures
* "[Structure Meaning]" provides a definition of each structure by its tag
* "[Enumeration Values]"  provides a definition of each enumeration value by its containing structure

### A Metasyntax for Structure Organization

The structures, with their payloads and substructures,
are represented using a custom metasyntax.
The intent of this metasyntax is to resemble the line encoding of allowable structures. In the metasyntax:

- White space is not significant.
- Options are placed between brackets `[` and `]` and have choices separated by pipes `|`.
- Named sets of rules are indicated with a name followed by `:=`.
- Level markers are used to indicate substructure relationships.
    - `0` means "must be a record"
    - `n` means "level inherited from rule instantiation"
    - `+1`, `+2`, etc, indicate nesting within nearest preceding structure with lesser level
- Rule instantiation is indicated by double angle-brackets (i.e. `<<`rule name`>>`)
- Line templates have several parts:
    - An optional cross-reference template `@XREF:`tag`@`, meaning this structure may be pointed to by other structures.
    - The tag is the standard tag for this structure.
        Due to the history of GEDCOM's design,
        standard tags are not always enough to fully determine structure type,
        but standard tag and superstructure type together are.
    - The payload is one of the following:
        - `@<XREF:`tag`>@` means a pointer to a structure with this cross-reference template
        - `<`structure type`>` means a non-pointer payload, as describe in [Structure Types](#structure-types)
        - nothing, meaning this structure *must not* have a payload
- Four cardinality markers are used:
    - `{0:1}` means "optional" -- zero or one expected.
        If more than one is provided, only the meaning of the first is defined by this document.
    - `{1:1}` means "required" -- one *must* be present.
        If more than one is provided, only the meaning of the first is defined by this document.
    - `{0:M}` means "any number allowed".
        Unless otherwise specified, the first is the most-preferred value;
        for example, the display name would be the first name structure,
        the profile image the first image structure, etc.
    - `{1:M}` means "any whole number allowed" -- at least one *must* be present, and more are allowed.
        Unless otherwise specified, the first is the most-preferred value;
        for example, the display name would be the first name structure,
        the profile image the first image structure, etc.

To refer to a a structure in the context of its superstructure,
tags are written with intervening periods.
For example, `GEDC`.`VERS` refers to a structure with tag `VERS`
and a superstructure with tag `GEDC`.


## Payload-type substructures

The following structures are permitted as a substructure of any structure with the given payload datatype, always with `{0:1}` cardinality.

| Substructure | Superstructure Payload Datatype |
|:------------ |:------------------------------- |
| `PHRASE`     | `<Age>`, `<DateValue>`, `<Enum>`, `@<XREF:INDI>@`, `@<XREF:PLACE>@` |
| `TIME`       | `<DateExact>` , `<DateValue>` |

Additionally, the `CONT` psuedo-structure is allowed as a way of encoding line breaks in any payload that contains them.

These usually listed explicitly in the [Structure Organization](#structure-organization) section. If they are missing, this is an oversight in the spec: they are always permitted under these datatypes, even if the speci neglected to note that in some context.

> **Question**: Should `LANG` be allowed under any `<Text>` datatype?

> **Question**: For presentation, is it better to show `PHRASE` and `TIME` in the grammar or not?

The header pseudo-structure provides metadata about the entire GEDCOM transmission.
A few substructure of note:

- `GEDC` gives the GEDCOM standard this transmission conforms to
- `SCHMA` gives the meaning of extension tags; see [Extensions](#extensions) for more.
- `SOUR` describes the originating software
    - `SOUR`.`CORP` describes the corporation creating the software
    - `SOUR`.`DATA` describes a larger database this data is extracted from
- `LANG` gives a default value for the rest of the transmission

The `FAM` record was originally structured to represent families where a male`HUSB` (husband/father) and female `WIFE` (wife/mother) produce `CHIL` (children).
The `FAM` record may also be used for cultural parallels to this,
including nuclear families, marriage, cohabitation, fostering, adoption, and so on, regardless of the gender of the partners.
Sex, gender, titles, and/or roles of partners should not be inferred from which is pointed to by the `HUSB` vs `WIFE` structure.

The individuals pointed to by the `HUSB` and `WIFE` are collectively referred to as "partners", "parents" or "spouses".

Some displays may be unable to display more than two partners.
Displays may use `HUSB` and `WIFE` as layout hints,
as e.g. by consistently displaying the `HUSB` on the same side of the `WIFE` in a tree view.
It is recommended that family structures with more than two partners
either use several `FAM` records
and/or use `<<ASSOCIATION_STRUCTURE>>`s to indicate additional partners.

> **Note**: The `FAM` record will be revised in a future version of GEDCOM to fully express the diversity of human family relationships.

The preferred order of the `CHIL` (children) pointers within a `FAM` (family) structure is chronological by birth.
A `CHIL` with a `voidPtr` indicates a placeholder for an unknown child in this birth order.

If a `FAM` record uses `HUSB` or `WIFE` to point to an `INDI` record,
the `INDI` record *must* use `FAMS` to point to the `FAM` record.
If a `FAM` record uses `CHIL` to point to an `INDI` record,
the `INDI` record *must* use a `FAMC` to point to the `FAM` record.

```

The individual record is a compilation of facts or hypothesized facts about an individual.
These facts may come from multiple sources.
Source citations and notes allow documentation of the source where each of the facts were discovered.

A single individual may have facts distributed across multiple individual records, connected by `ALIA` (alias, in the computing sense not the pseudonym sense) pointers.
See `ALIA` for more.

Individual records are linked to Family records by use of bi-directional pointers.
Details about those links are stored as substructures of the pointers in the individual record.

Other associations or relationships are represented by the `ASSO` (association) tag.
The person's relation or associate is the person being pointed to.
The association or relationship is stated by the value on the subordinate `ROLE` line.
For example:

```gedcom
0 @I1@ INDI
1 NAME Fred/Jones/
1 ASSO @I2@
2 ROLE GODP
```

Events stored as facts within an `INDI` record may also have `FAMC` or `ASSO` tags to indicate families and individuals that participated in those events.
For example,
a `FAMC` pointer subordinate to an adoption event indicates a relationship to family by adoption;
biological parents can be shown by a `FAMC` pointer subordinate to the birth event;
the eulogist at a funeral can be shown by am `ASSO` pointer subordinate to the burial event;
and so on.

```

A place or named geographical, political, or other region, jurisdiction, or location.
Each place may be known by one or several names,
which may be be translated or transliterated using `TRAN` structures.
Each place may also have

- `TYPE`: a place type name, such as "church", "city" or "burgh".

- `WITHIN`: a larger place which this place is a part of, such as a city being within a county.
    It is intended that this be the next larger region;
    for example, the place record for a city
    which is inside a county which is inside a state
    should point to the place record of the county, not the state.

- `MAP`: a representative geographical coordinate within the region.

Subsequent versions of GEDCOM will include additional substructures in place records to support the time-varying, contested, and partially-overlapping nature of some places.

For example, a record describing births throughout all the cities of Oneida county could be recorded as

```gedcom
0 @S1@ SOUR
1 DATA
2 EVEN BIRT
3 WHERE @P1@
0 @P1@ PLACE
1 NAME Oneida
1 TYPE County
1 WITHIN @P2@
0 @P2@ PLACE
1 NAME Idaho
1 TYPE State
1 WITHIN @P3@
0 @P3@ PLACE
1 NAME United States of America
1 TYPE Nation
```

> **Note**: there is ongoing work to expand the expressivity of places, and a future version of GEDCOM is likely to include multiple additions to this record. For example, `TYPE` may gain multiple langage-tagged values; `WITHIN` may allow multiple regions with different types of containment; `MAP`s may be expanded to store a region, not just a single point; etc.

Prior to GEDCOM 7, place hierarchies were stored as comma-separated lists from smallest to largest region.
Because relevant jurisdictional data may not be available to correctly construct linked place records, conversion of pre-7 data may place that entire name inside the `NAME` of a single place record, as e.g.

```gedcom
0 @P0@ PLACE
1 NAME Richmond, , VA, USA
```

Such comma-separated representation is permitted only for backwards compatibility
and should be corrected with an appropriate hierarchy of place records as soon as the relevant information can be collected.

> **Note**: The most common reason a comma-separated list might not be separable into a set of individual place records is that a blank in the list could mean either (a) "there is no place here" (as e.g. Richmond VA not being in a county when most US cities are) or (b) "I don't know the name of this place".

An institution or person that has one or more sources as part of their collection(s).
Informal repositories include the owner of an unpublished work or of a rare published source, or a keeper of personal collections.
An example would be the owner of a family Bible containing unpublished family genealogical entries.

Layered repositories, such as an archive containing copies of a subset of records from another archive or archives that have moved or been bought by other archives, are not modeled in this version of GEDCOM.
It is expected they will be added in a later version.
Until such time, it is recommended that the repository record store current contact information if such is known.

A description of an entire source.
A source *may* also point to `REPO`s to describe repositories or archives where the source document may be found.
The part of a source relevant to a specific fact, such as specific page or entry, is indicated in a `SOURCE_CITATION` that points to the source record.

The submitter record identifies an individual or organization that contributed information contained in the GEDCOM transmission.
All records in the transmission are assumed to be submitted by the
submitter referenced in the `HEAD`,
unless a `SUBM` structure inside a specific record points at a different submitter record.

### Substructures

  +1 CTRY <Special>                            {0:1}
```

A specific building, plot, or location.
The payload is the full formatted address as it would appear on a mailing label, including appropriate line breaks (encoded using `CONT` tags).
The expected order of address components varies by region; the address should be organized as expected by the addressed region.

Optionally, additional substructures such as `STAE` and `CTRY` are provided to be used by systems that have structured their addresses for indexing and sorting. If the substructures and `ADDR` payload disagree, the `ADDR` payload shall be taken as correct.
Because the regionally-correct order and formatting of address components cannot be determined from the substructures alone, the `ADDR` payload is required, even if its content appears to be redundant with the substructures.


#### `ASSOCIATION_STRUCTURE` :=

- `REFN` is a user-generated identifier for a structure.

- `UID` is a globally-unique identifier for a structure.

- `EXID` is an identifier for the suibject of the stucture.

#### `NON_EVENT_STRUCTURE` :=

```gedstruct
n NO <Enum>                                    {1:1}
  +1 PHRASE <Text>                             {0:1}

  +1 <<SOURCE_CITATION>>                       {0:M}
```

Indicates that an event, given in the payload, did not happen within a given date period
(or never happened if there is no `DATE` substructure).

Substructures may provide discussion as to the non-occurrence of the event
but must not limit the meaning of the event.
For example, `1 NO DEAT`{.gedcom} means "no death occurred";
no substructure other than `DATE` may restrict the breadth of that assertion.


#### `NOTE_FLAT` :=

```gedstruct
n NOTE <Text>                                  {1:1}

  +1 LANG <Special>                            {0:1}
```

Like `NOTE_STRUCUTURE`, but without substructures that can contain additional notes.

#### `NOTE_STRUCTURE` :=

```gedstruct
n NOTE <Text>                                  {1:1}

  +1 LANG <Special>                            {0:1}
```

A catch-all location for information that does not fully fit within other structures.
May include research notes, additional context, alternative interpretations, reasoning, etc.

#### `PERSONAL_NAME_PART` :=

```gedstruct
n PART <Text>                                  {1:1}
  +1 TYPE <Enum>                               {0:M}
     +2 PHRASE <Text>                          {0:1}
```

A name or sequence of names all sharing the same type.
The order of `PART` substructures of a name is the order the parts of a name appear when written out in full.
They should not be reordered base on their `TYPE` substructures.

If a `PART` has multiple `TYPE`s, all apply to that entire part.
Multiple `PART`s may have the same `TYPE`.

A part with an empty payload may be used to represent that a name with the indicated type is not present.
For example, a person with three given names, Johann D. Alfred, where Johann is also rufname and having no know surname, could be represented as follows:

```gedcom
0 @I1@ INDI
1 NAME
2 PART Johann
3 TYPE GIVN
3 TYPE RUFNAME
2 PART D. Alfred
3 TYPE GIVN
2 PART
3 TYPE SURN
```

The current set of available name part types is inadequate for many cultures and will be expanded in a future version of GEDCOM.
A `PART` with no `TYPE` may be used when no available `TYPE` suffices or when the type is not known.


#### `PERSONAL_NAME_STRUCTURE` :=

```gedstruct
n NAME                                         {1:1}

  +1 <<NOTE_STRUCTURE>>                        {0:M}
  +1 <<SOURCE_CITATION>>                       {0:M}
```

Names of individuals are represented in one or more parts.
Each part should contain a name or sequence of names with the same type, and should include any spacing and punctuation that would be included if that part were displayed in isolation.
The order of parts should correspond to the display order preferred by the named individual.

During display, parts may be separated by spacing and punctuation in a locale-dependent manner: for example, an English name may be displayed horizontally with spaces between parts and a comma before the name suffix; a Japanese name may be concatenated vertically with no intervening spaces or punctuation; etc.

The name may be translated or transliterated into different languages or scripts using the `TRAN` substructure.
It is recommended, but not required, that each translation use the same name parts and types.

A `TYPE` is used to specify the particular variation that this name is.
For example; it could indicate that this name is a name taken at immigration or that it could be an ‘also known as’ name.
See the `NAME`.`TYPE` enumeration for more.

The data provided in the `<<SOURCE_CITATION>>` structure is source-related information specific to the data being cited.
Include a pointer to a source record that describes a source,
optionally augmented with additional information about how that source applies to the subject of the citation's superstructure:

- `PAGE`: where in the source the relevant material can be found
- `DATA`: the relevant data from the source
- `EVEN`: what event the relevant material was recording
- `QUAY`: an estimation of the reliability of the source in regard to these claims

> **Question**: should we rename this `CITE` instead of `SOUR`?

#### `SOURCE_REPOSITORY_CITATION` :=

```gedstruct
n REPO @<XREF:REPO>@                           {1:1}

        +3 PHRASE <Text>                       {0:1}
```

This structure is used within a source record to point to a name and address record of the holder of the
source document.
Formal and informal repository name and addresses are stored in the
`REPOSITORY_RECORD`.
More formal repositories, such as the Family History Library, should show a call number of the source at that repository.
The call number of that source should be recorded using a `CALN` substructure.



## Structure Meaning

### Events

As a general rule, events are things that happen on a specific date. 
Use the `DateRange` form to indicate that an event took place at some time between two dates.
In most cases, a `DatePeriod` is inappropriate for an event; if the subject of your recording occurred over a period of time, then it is probably not an event, but rather an attribute.

Event structures can be used to record notes about an event without asserting the event actually occurred.
An event structure asserts the event did occur if any of the following are true:

- There is a `DATE` substructure; for example
    
    ````gedcom
    1 DEAT
    2 DATE 2 OCT 1937
    ````

- There is a `WHERE` substructure; for example
    
    ````gedcom
    1 DEAT
    2 WHERE @P1@
    ````

- The event has a payload.
    A special payload `Y` can be used with some event types to indicate that the event is known to have occurred without providing any additional information about it.
    For example,
    
    ````gedcom
    1 DEAT Y
    ````

If none of the above are true, the structure should be seen as a place for inconclusive research notes about the possibility of the event.
An assertion that an event did not occur should be encoded using the `NO` structure.

In addition, `FACT` is a structure for a generic family attribute.

### LDS Ordinances

LDS ordinance structures are unlike regular events in that they might either be performed during life or by proxy on the behalf of a deceased individual.

Proxy LDS ordinances were once requested and officially recorded using GEDCOM.
This is no longer the case; however, it should be noted that when it was the case the following two principles held:

- `WHERE` was used only for ordinance that were performed by the recipient.
- `TEMP` was used with all `ENDL`, `SLGC`, and `SGLS`, but only with posthumous proxy `BAPL` and `CONFL`.


Tag | Name | Meaning
----|------|-----------------
`BAPL` | baptism | The event of baptism performed at age eight or later by priesthood authority of the LDS Church. (See also `BAPM`)
`CONL` | confirmation | The religious event by which a person receives membership in the LDS Church. (See also `CONF`)
`ENDL` | endowment | A religious event where an endowment ordinance for an individual was performed by priesthood authority in an LDS temple.
`SLGC` | sealing child | A religious event pertaining to the sealing of a child to his or her parents in an LDS temple ceremony.
`SLGS` | sealing spouse | A religious event pertaining to the sealing of a husband and wife in an LDS temple ceremony.



### Tag-defined Structures

Each of these structures is defined with a single meaning per tag.
As such, extensions may place these anywhere in a GEDCOM transmission, not just where they are located in [Structure Organization],
provided the same meaning is preserved.

#### `ABBR` (Abbreviation)

A short name of a title, description, or name used for sorting, filing, and retrieving records.

#### `ADDR` (Address)

The location of, or most relevant to, the subject of the superstructure.
See `ADDRESS_STRUCTURE` for more.

#### `ADR1` (Address Line 1)

The first line of the address, used for indexing.
This is the value of the line corresponding to the `ADDR` tag line in the address structure.

#### `ADR2` (Address Line 2)

The second line of the address, used for indexing.
This is the value of the first `CONT` line subordinate to the `ADDR` tag in the address structure.

#### `AGE` (Age at Event)

The age of the individual at the time an event occurred, or the age listed in the document.

#### `AGNC` (Responsible Agency)

The organization, institution, corporation, person, or other entity that has responsibility for the associated context.
For example, an employer of a person of an associated occupation, or a Church that administered rites or events, or an organization responsible for creating or archiving records.

#### `ALIA` (Alias)

A single individual may have facts distributed across multiple individual records, connected by `ALIA` pointers
(named after "alias" in the computing sense, not the pseudonym sense).

> **Note**:
> This standard does not define how to connect `INDI` records with `ALIA`.
> Some systems organize `ALIA` pointers to create a tree structure, with the root `INDI` record containing the composite view of all facts in the leaf `INDI` records.
> Others distribute events and attributes between `INDI` records mutually linked by symmetric pairs of `ALIA` pointers.
> A future version of GEDCOM may adjust the definition of `ALIA`.

#### `ANCI` (Ancestor Interest)

Indicates an interest in additional research for ancestors of this individual.
(See also `DESI`).

#### `ASSO` (Associates)

A pointer to an associated individual.
See `ASSOCIATION_STRUCTURE` for more.

#### `ASSOT` (Associates)

A description of one or more associated individuals.
See `ASSOCIATION_STRUCTURE` for more.

#### `AUTH` (Author)

The person, agency, or entity who created the record. For a published work, this could be the author, compiler, transcriber, abstractor, or editor. For an unpublished source, this may be an individual, a government agency, church organization, or private organization, etc.

#### `CALN` (Call Number)

An identification or reference description used to file and retrieve items from the holdings of a repository.
Despite the word "number" in the name, may contain any character, not just digits.

#### `CAUS` (Cause)

Used in special cases to record the reasons which precipitated an event.
Often used subordinate to a death event to show cause of death, such as might be listed on a death certificate.

#### `CHAN` (Change)

The most recent change to the superstructure.
This is metadata about the structure itself, not data about its subject.
See `CHANGE_DATE` for more.

#### `CHIL` (Child)

The child in a family, whether biological, adopted, foster, sealed, etc.

#### `CITY` (City)

The name of the city used in the address, used for sorting or indexing.

#### `CONT` (Continued)

A pseudo-structure to indicate a lane break.
See [Lines](#lines) for more.

#### `COPR` (Copyright)

A copyright statement, as appropriate for the copyright laws applicable to this data.

#### `CORP` (Corporate Name)

Name of the business, corporation, or person that produced or commissioned the product.

#### `CREA` (Creation)

The initial creation of the superstructure.
This is metadata about the structure itself, not data about its subject.
See `CREATION_DATE` for more.

#### `CROP`

Describes a subregion of an image to display.
Only valid when the superstructure references an image with a defined pixel unit.

`LEFT` and `TOP` indicate the top-left corner of the region to display;
`WIDTH` and `HEIGHT` indicate how many pixels wide and tall the region to display is.
If omitted, `LEFT` and `TOP` each default to 0;
`WIDTH` defaults to the image width minus `LEFT`;
and `HEIGHT` defaults to the image height minus `TOP`.

It is an error for 

- `LEFT` or `LEFT` + `WIDTH` to exceed the image width
- `TOP` or `TOP` + `HEIGHT` to exceed the image height
- `CROP` to be applied to a non-image or image without a defined pixel unit


#### `CTRY` (Country)

The name of the country that pertains to the associated address. Isolated by some systems for sorting or indexing.

#### `DESI` (Descendant Interest)

Indicates an interest in research to identify additional descendants of this individual.
(See also `ANCI`.)

#### `DEST` (Destination)

An identifier for the system expected to receive this transmission.
See `HEAD`.`SOUR` for guidance on choosing identifiers.

#### `EMAIL` (E-Mail)

An electronic mail address, as defined by any relevant standard
such as [RFC 3696](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3696), [RFC 5321](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5321), [RFC 5322](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322), etc.

If an invalid email address is present upon import, it should be preserved as-is on export.

> **Note**: GEDCOM 5.5.1 contained a typo where this tag was sometimes written `EMAI` and sometimes written `EMAIL`. `EMAIL` should be used in GEDCOM 7.0.0 and later.

#### `EXID` (External Identifier)

An identifier for the subject of the superstructure as maintained by some external authority.
The authority owning the identifier is provided in the `TYPE` substructure; see `EXID`.`TYPE` for more.

Note that `EXID` identifies a subject, while `UID` and `REFN` identify a structure.
For example, two `INDI` records describing the same person would be expected to have distinct `UID` but the same `EXID`.

#### `FAM`

See `FAMILY_RECORD`

#### `FACT`

Pertaining to a noteworthy attribute or fact concerning an individual, a group, or an organization.
If a specific attribute type exists, it should be used instead of a generic `FACT` structure.
Each `FACT` shall be classified by a subordinate use of the `TYPE` tag
and may be further described in the structure's payload.

For example, if the attribute being defined was one of the person's skills, such as woodworking, the `FACT` tag would have the value of "Woodworking", followed by a subordinate `TYPE` tag with the value "Skills".

```gedcom
0 @I1@ INDI
1 FACT Woodworking
2 TYPE Skills
```

 
#### `FAMC` (Family Child)

Identifies the family in which an individual appears as a child.
Also used with a `STAT` substructure to show individuals who are not children of the family.
See `FAM` and `FAMC`.`STAT` for more.

#### `FAMS` (Famiy Spouse)

Identifies the family in which an individual appears as a partner.
See `FAM` for more.

#### `FAX` (Facsimile)

A FAX telephone number appropriate for sending data facsimiles.
See `PHON` for more.

#### `FILE` (File)

A reference to an external file.
The value of the FILE tag can either be an *external* reference or a *local* reference.

An *external* reference begins with `http://`, `https://`, or `ftp://`
and is a URL; see `WWW` for more on URLs.

A *local* reference is a file path in DOS format (i.e., with `\` as directory separators).

> **Question**: What (if any) limitations do we need to put on file names? Do we need to list escaping mechanisms?
>
> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filename#Comparison_of_filename_limitations> shows that most file systems do allow line breaks in file names (though NTFS and most FAT systems do not); most allow 255-character names (but some are smaller), etc.

> **Question**: Would it be simpler to have local references be relative URLs instead? Then we can simply appeal to URL escaping...

> **Question**: Should we prohibit absolute paths in local references (or `file://` URLs if we switch to only URL) because they are not transmittable with the file?

It is recommended that local references be used only with [the GEDZIP file format](#gedzip) and as such be simple filenames with no directories.

#### `FORM`

The media type of the file referenced by the superstructure.
This should be a valid media type as defined by [IETC BCP 13](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp13).

#### `GEDC` (Gedcom)

A container for information about the entire transmission.

#### `HEAD` (Header)

A pseudo-structure for storing metadata about the transmission.
See [The Header and Trailer](#the-header) for more.

#### `HEIGHT`

How many pixels to display vertically of the image.
See `CROP` for more.

#### `INDI` (Individual)

See `INDIVIDUAL_RECORD`.

#### `LANG`

The human language of the superstructure.
In the header, this provides the default language for the entire transmission.
In a `SUBMITTER_RECORD`, it provides a language the subject of that record understands.
Elsewhere it provides the language in which the `Text`-typed payloads of superstructure and its substructures appears.

The payload of `LANG` structure is a language tag, as defined by [IETF BCP 47](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47).
A [registry of component subtags](https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry) is maintained publicly by the IANA.

#### `LATI` (Latitude)

A latitudinal coordinate. The latitude coordinate is the direction North or South from the equator in degrees and fraction of degrees.
For example: 18 degrees, 9 minutes, and 3.4 seconds North would be formatted as `N18.150944`.
Minutes and seconds are converted by dividing the minutes value by 60 and the seconds value by 3600 and adding the results together. This sum becomes the fractional part of the degree's value.

#### `LEFT`

A number of pixels to not display from the left side of the image.
See `CROP` for more.

#### `LONG` (Longitude)

A longitudinal coordinate. The longitude coordinate is degrees and fraction of degrees east or west of the zero or base meridian coordinate.
For example: 168 degrees, 9 minutes, and 3.4 seconds East would be formatted as `E168.150944`.
See `LATI` for more.

#### `MAP` (Map)

A representative point for a location,
as defined by `LATI` and `LONG` substructures.

Note that `MAP`  provides
neither a notion of accuracy
(e.g., the `MAP` for a birth event may be some distance from the point where the birth occurred)
nor a notion of region size
(e.g., the `MAP` for a place "Belarus" may be anywhere within that nation's 0.2 million square kilometer area).


#### `MEDI` (Medium)

Identifies information about the media or having to do with the medium in which information is stored.

#### `MIME` (Media Type)

Indicates the media type of the payload of the superstructure,
as defined by [IETC BCP 13](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp13).

Only two media types are supported by this structure in this version of GEDCOM:

- `text/plain` shall be presented to the user as-is, preserving all spacing, line breaks, etc.

- `text/html` uses HTML tags to provide presentation information.
    Applications should support at least the following:
    
    - `p` and `br` elements for paragraphing and line breaks
    - `b`, `i`, and `u` elements for bold, italic, and underlined text, or corresponding display in other locales; see [HTML §4.5](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html) for more
    - `sup` and `sub` elements for super- and sub-script
    - The three XML entities that appear in text: `&amp;`, `&lt;` `&gt;`.
        Note that `&quote;` and `&apos;` are only needed in attributes.
        Other entities should be represented as their respective Unicode characters instead.
    
    Supporting more of HTML is encouraged.
    Unsupported elements should be ignored during display.

> **Note**: Media types are also used by external files, as described under `FORM`. External file media types are not limited to `text/plain` and `text/html`.

#### `NO` (Did not happen)

Identifies an event type which did not occur to the superstructure's subject.
See `NON_EVENT_STRUCTURE` for more.

The payload is a single event-type tag name.
See [Events].



#### `OBJE` (Object)

An external file containing information pertinent to the subject of the superstructure if a substructure,
or a description of such a file if a record.
See `MULTIMEDIA_RECORD` for more.

#### `PAGE` (Page)

Specific location within the information referenced. For a published work, this could include the volume of a multi-volume work and the page number(s). For a periodical, it could include volume, issue, and page numbers. For a newspaper, it could include a date, page number, and column number. For an unpublished source or microfilmed works, this could be a film or sheet number, page number, frame number, etc. A census record might have an enumerating district, page number, line number, dwelling number, and family number.

It is recommended that the data in this field be formatted comma-separated with label:value pairs, such as 

```gedcom
2 SOUR @S1@
3 PAGE Film: 1234567, Frame: 344, Line: 28
```

#### `PART` (Payload Part)

A portion of a string about which specific claims may be made.
For example, a personal name is often a sequence of name parts,
some of which have types.

`PART` must only appear as a substructure of a structure with no payload.

The full display payload of the superstructure of `PART` is the concatenation of all its `PART` substructures in order.
The superstructure should define if spacing punctuation, etc., is permitted between parts during the concatenation.

#### `PEDI` (Pedigree)

A code used to indicate the child to family relationship for pedigree navigation purposes.

#### `PHON` (Phone)

A telephone number.
Telephone numbers have many regional variations and may contain non-digit characters.
Users should be encouraged to use internationalized telephone numbers rather than local versions.
As a starting point for this recommendation, there are international standards that use a '+' shorthand for the international prefix (e.g. in place of 011 in US or 00 in UK).
For instance, `+1 (555) 555-1234` (US) or `+44 20 1234 1234` (UK).

See ITU standards [E.123](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-E.123) and [E.164](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-E.164) for more information.

#### `PHRASE`

Textual information that cannot be expressed in the superstructure due to the limitations of its datatype.

For example,

- a date interpreted from the phrase "The Feast of St John" might be

    ````gedcom
    2 DATE 24 JUNE 1852
    3 PHRASE During the feast of St John
    ````

- a record using `1648/9` to indicate a change in new year might become
    
    ````gedcom
    2 DATE 30 JAN 1649
    3 PHRASE 30th of January, 1648/9
    ````

- a record using `1648/9` to indicate uncertainty in the year might become
    
    ````gedcom
    2 DATE BET 1648 AND 1649
    3 PHRASE 1648/9
    ````

- a record using `Q1 1867` to indicate an event occurred sometime within the first quarter of 1867 might become
    
    ````gedcom
    2 DATE BET 1 JAN 1867 AND 31 MAR 1867
    3 PHRASE Q1 1867
    ````
    
- a record that records the sandek in a circumcision might become
    
    ````gedcom
    1 EVEN
    2 TYPE Circumcision
    2 ASSO @I2@
    3 ROLE GODP
    4 PHRASE Sandek
    ````

- a name given to a foundling orphan might be
    
    ````gedcom
    1 NAME
    2 PART Mary
    3 TYPE GIVN
    2 TYPE OTHER
    3 PHRASE given by orphanage
    ````

Although [Structure Organization](#structure-organiztion) lists `PHRASE` substructures only for a few structures, implementations are encouraged to support `PHRASE` for all non-`Text` payloads.

#### `PLACE`

A named place or region.
See `PLACE_RECORD` for more.

#### `POST` (Postal code)

A code used by a postal service to identify an area to facilitate mail handling.
Isolated by some systems for sorting or indexing.

#### `PUBL` (Publication)

When and where the record was created. For published works, this includes information such as the city of publication, name of the publisher, and year of publication.

For an unpublished work, it includes the date the record was created and the place where it was created. For example, the county and state of residence of a person making a declaration for a pension or the city and state of residence of the writer of a letter.

#### `QUAY` (Quality of data)

The submitter's evaluation of the credibility of a piece of information, based on its supporting evidence.
Some systems use this feature to rank multiple conflicting opinions for display of most likely information first.
It is not intended to eliminate the receivers' need to evaluate the evidence for themselves.

#### `REFN` (Reference)

A user-defined number or text that the submitter uses to identify the superstructure.
For instance, it may be a record number within the submitter's automated or manual system, or it may be a page and position number on a pedigree chart.

This is metadata about the structure itself, not data about its subject.
Multiple structures describing different aspects of the same subject would have different `REFN` values.


#### `REPO` (Repository)

If a record, see `REPOSITORY_RECORD`.
If a substructure, see `SOURCE_REPOSITORY_CITATION`.

#### `RESI` (Residence)

An address or place of residence that a family or individual resided.

#### `RESN` (Restriction)

A processing indicator signifying access to information may be denied or otherwise restricted.

The `RESN` structure is provided to assist software in filtering data that should not be exported or otherwise used in a particular context. It is recommended that tools provide an interface to allow users to filter data on export
such that certain `RESN` structure payloads result in the `RESN` structure and its superstructure being removed from the export.
Such removal must not violate GEDCOM constraints: see [Removing data](#removing-data) for more.

This is metadata about the structure itself, not data about its subject.

#### `ROLE` (Role)

Indicates what role this person played in an event or person's life.

For example, the following indicates a child's birth record as the source of the mother's name:

```gedcom
0 @I1@ INDI
1 NAME
2 PART Mary
2 SOUR @S1@
3 EVEN BIRT
4 ROLE MOTH
```

The following indicates that a person's friend was a witness at their baptism,

```gedcom
0 @I2@ INDI
1 ASSO @I3@
2 ROLE FRIEND
1 BAPM
2 ASSO @I3@
3 ROLE WITN
```

#### `SDATE` (Sort Date)

A date to be used as a sorting hint.
Intended for use when the actual date is unknown but display order may be dependent on date.

If both a `DATE` and `SDATE` are present in the same structure,
the `SDATE` should be used for sorting and positioning
while the `DATE` should be displayed as the date of the structure.

#### `SEX` (Sex)

A code that indicates the sex of the individual.
 
#### `HEAD`.`SOUR` (Source System)

An identifier for the product producing this GEDCOM transmission.
A registration process for these identifiers existed for a time, but no longer does.
If an existing identifier is known, it should be used.
Otherwise, a URI owned by the product should be used instead.

#### `SOUR` (Source)

A description of an entire source (if a record)
or the relevant part thereof to support the containing data (if a substructure).
See `SOURCE_RECORD` and `SOURCE_CITATION` for more.

#### `STAE` (State)

A geographical division of a larger jurisdictional area, such as a State within the United States of America.
Isolated for sorting or indexing.

#### `STAT` (Status)

An assessment of the state or condition of something.

#### `SUBM` (Submitter)

A contributor of information in the substructure,
or a description of such a contributor if a record.
As a substructure, this is metadata about the structure itself, not data about its subject.
See `SUBMITTER_RECORD` for more.

#### `TEMP` (Temple)

The name of an LDS Church Temple.
Previous editions of GEDCOM recommended using a set of abbreviations for temple names, but that list is no longer published by the church and using abbreviations is no longer recommended.


#### `TEXT` (Text from Source)

A verbatim copy of any description contained within the source.
This indicates notes or text that are actually contained in the source document, not the submitter's opinion about the source.
This should be, from the evidence point of view, "what the original record keeper said" as opposed to the researcher's interpretation.

#### `TIME` (Time)

A time value in a 24-hour clock format.

#### `TOP`

A number of pixels to not display from the top side of the image.
See `CROP` for more.

#### `TRLR` (TRAILER)

A pseudo-structure marking the end of a GEDCOM transmission.
See [The Header and Trailer](#the-header) for more.

#### `TRAN` (Translation or transliteration)

A translation or transliteration of the superstructure.
Presents information in the same format as he superstructure, but with a different language tag.
See `PLACE_RECORD`, `PERSONAL_NAME_STRUTURE`, and `LANG` for more.


#### `UID` (Unique Identifier)

A globally-unique identifier of the superstructure,
to be preserved across edits.
If a globally-unique identifier for the record already exists, it should be used without modification, not even whitespace or letter case normalization.
New globally unique identifiers should be created and formatted as described in [RFC 4122](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122).

This is metadata about the structure itself, not data about its subject.
Multiple structures describing different aspects of the same subject would have different `UID` values.

> **Note**: Some systems used a 16-byte UUID with a custom 2-byte checksum for a total of 18 bytes:
> 
> - checksum byte 1 = 
    $\left(\sum_{i=1}^{16} b_i\right) \mod 256$
> - checksum byte 2 =
    $\left(\sum_{i=1}^{16} (16-i)b_i\right) \mod 256$
>
> where <var>b<sub>i</sub></var> is byte <var>i</var>.


#### `VERS` (Version)

An identifier that represents the version level assigned to the associated product.
It is defined and changed by the creators of the product.

Starting with 7.0.0, GEDCOM versions (in `HEAD`.`GEDC`.`VERS`) follow the semantic versioning specification given at <https://semver.org>.

#### `WHERE`

The principle place in which the superstructure's subject occurred.

#### `WIDTH`

How many pixels to display horizontally of the image.
See `CROP` for more.

#### `WWW` (Web)

A URL or other locator for a World Wide Web page,
as defined by any relevant standard
such as [whatwg/url](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/),
[RFC 3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986),
[RFC 3987](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3987),
etc.

If an invalid web address is present upon import, it should be preserved as-is on export.







### Context-defined Structures

#### `DATA`

##### `HEAD`.`SOUR`.`DATA` (Source Data)

The electronic data source or digital repository from which this GEDCOM transmission was exported.
The payload is the name of that source,
with substructures providing additional details.

#### `SOUR`.`DATA` (Data)

A container for storing information about the data contained within a source.

#### `DATE`

In general, the principle date of the subject of the superstructure.
Has specific meaning in some contexts:

##### (LDS Ordinance).`DATE` (Date performed)

LDS Ordinances may be performed by proxy after an individual's death.
The presence of an LDS ordinance date should not be taken to suggest the individual was living at that time.

##### `HEAD`.`SOUR`.`DATA`.`DATE` (Publication date)

The publication date of the source

##### .`SOUR`.`DATA`.`DATE` (Date period covered)

The period during which this source recorded events.

##### (other).`SOUR`.`DATA`.`DATE` (Entry recording date)

The date at which the cited data was entered into the source.

##### `HEAD`.`DATE` (Transmission date)

The date that this transmission or file was created.

##### `PLACE`.`NAME`.`DATE`

The date (usually a `DatePeriod`) when the place was known by this name.

#### `EVEN`

##### `INDI`.`EVEN` and `FAM`.`EVEN` (Event)

Pertaining to a noteworthy happening related to an individual, a group, or an organization.
If a specific event type exists, it should be used instead of a generic `EVEN` structure.
Each `EVEN` shall be classified by a subordinate use of the `TYPE` tag
and may be further described in the structure's payload.

For example, a person that signed a lease for land dated October 2, 1837 and a lease for mining equipment dated November 4, 1837 would be written in
GEDCOM as:

```gedcom
0 @I1@ INDI
1 EVEN
2 TYPE Land Lease
2 DATE 2 OCT 1837
1 EVEN Mining equipment
2 TYPE Equipment Lease
2 DATE 4 NOV 1837
```


##### `SOUR`.`DATA`.`EVEN` (Events recorded)

An enumeration of the different kinds of events that were recorded in a particular source.
Each enumeration is separated by a comma.
For example, a parish register of births, deaths, and marriages would be `BIRT`, `DEAT`, `MARR`.

##### `SOUR`.`EVEN` (Event type cited from)

A code that indicates the type of event which was responsible for the source entry being recorded.
For example, if the entry was created to record a birth of a child, then the type would be `BIRT` regardless of the assertions made from that record, such as the mother's name or mother's birth date.

#### `HUSB`

##### `FAM`.`HUSB`

A partner in a `FAM` record.
See `FAMILY_RECORD` for more.

##### `FAM`.(event or attribute).`HUSB`

Information relevant to the subject of the superstructure
specific to the individual described by the containing `FAM`'s `HUSB` substructure.


#### `NAME`

The name of the superstructure's subject.

##### `INDI`.`NAME`

A `PERSONAL_NAME_STRUCTURE` with parts, translations, sources, etc.

##### (other).`NAME`

A simple string.


#### `NOTE` (Note)

Additional information provided by the submitter for understanding the enclosing data.

##### `HEAD`.`NOTE`

A note that a user enters to describe the contents of the transmission in terms of "ancestors or descendants of" so that the person receiving the data knows what genealogical information the
transmission contains.


#### `TITL`

##### `SOUR`.`TITL` (source descriptive title)

The title of the work, record, or item and, when appropriate, the title of the larger work or series of which it is a part.

A published work, a book for example, might have a title plus the title of the series of which the book is a part. A magazine article would have a title plus the title of the magazine that published the article.

For an unpublished work, titles should be descriptive and appropriate to the work, such as:

* A letter might include the date, the sender, and the receiver.
* A transaction between a buyer and seller might have their names and the transaction date.
* A family Bible containing genealogical information might have past and present owners and a physical description of the book. 
* A personal interview would cite the informant and interviewer.

##### `FILE`.`TITL` (descriptive title)

The title of the media file.

##### `INDI`.`TITL`

See [Individual Attributes].


#### `TYPE` (Type)

A further qualification to the meaning of the associated superior tag.
Some are the form of a short qualifying note;
others are taken from a set of known values.

In some cases both a `NOTE` and free-text `TYPE` are permitted as substructures of the same structure.
The difference between a non-enumeration `TYPE` and a `NOTE`
is that displaying systems should always display the `TYPE` value
when they display the data from the associated structure,
while `NOTE` will typically be visible only in a detailed view.

##### `REFN`.`TYPE`

A user-defined definition of superstructure.

##### `NAME`.`TYPE` and `PART`.`TYPE`

The type of the name or part thereof.

##### (event or attribute).`TYPE`

A descriptive word or phrase used to further classify the event or attribute.
This should be used whenever either of the generic `EVEN` or `FACT` tags are used.
It may also be used for any other event or attribute.

The payload classifies the event or fact being cited.
Using the subordinate `TYPE` classification method provides a further classification of the superstructure but does not change its basic meaning.
For example, a `MARR` with a `TYPE` could clarify what kind of marriage was performed:

```gedcom
0 @I1@ INDI
1 MARR
2 TYPE Common Law
```

This classifies the entry as a common law marriage but the event is still a marriage event.
Other descriptor values might include, for example,

- "Stillborn" as a qualifier to `BIRT` (birth)
- "Tribal Custom" as a qualifier to `MARR` (marriage)
- "College" as a a qualifier to `GRAD` (graduation)

See also `FACT` and `INDI`.`EVEN` and `FAM`.`EVEN` for additional examples.

##### `EXID`.`TYPE`

The authority issuing the `EXID`.
It is recommended that this be a URL
and that appending the `EXID` payload to it yields the URL of a webpage describing the indentified subject.

##### `PLACE`.`TYPE`

The jurisdictional type of the subject of the superstructure,
such as "Borough", "City", "County", "Megye", "Nation", etc.


#### `WIFE`

##### `FAM`.`WIFE`

A partner in a `FAM` record.
See `FAMILY_RECORD` for more.

##### `FAM`.(event or attribute).`WIFE`

Information relevant to the subject of the superstructure
specific to the individual described by the containing `FAM`'s `WIFE` substructure.


## Enumeration Values

### `FAMC`.`ADOP`

| Value | Meaning |
| :---- | :------ |
| `HUSB` | Adopted by the `HUSB` of the `FAM` pointed to by `FAMC` |
| `WIFE` | Adopted by the `WIFE` of the `FAM` pointed to by `FAMC` |
| `BOTH` | Adopted by both `HUSB` and `WIFE` of the `FAM` pointed to by `FAMC` |

> **Note**: The structures for foster children in particular, and family relationships in general, are known to have undesirable limitations and are likely to change in a future version of GEDCOM.

### `QUAY`

| Value | Meaning                             |
| :---- | :---------------------------------- |
| `0` | Unreliable evidence or estimated data |
| `1` | Questionable reliability of evidence (interviews, census, oral genealogies, or potential for bias, such as an autobiography) |
| `2` | Secondary evidence, data officially recorded sometime after the event |
| `3` | Direct and primary evidence used, or by dominance of the evidence |

Although the values look like integers, they do not have numeric meaning.

### `RESN`

One of the following:

| Value | Meaning                      |
| :---- | :--------------------------- |
| `CONFIDENTIAL` | This data was marked as confidential by the user. |
| `LOCKED` | Some systems may ignore changes to this data. |
| `PRIVACY` | This data is not to be shared outside of a trusted circle, generally because it contains information about living individuals. |

### `ROLE`

| Value | Meaning |
| ----- | :------ |
| `CHIL` | Child |
| `CLERGY` | Religious official in event; implies `OFFICIATOR` |
| `FATH` | Father; implies `PARENT` |
| `FRIEND` | Friend |
| `GODP` | Godparent or related role in other religions |
| `HUSB` | Husband; implies `SPOU` |
| `MOTH` | Mother; implies `PARENT` |
| `NGHBR` | Neighbor |
| `OFFICIATOR` | Officiator of the event |
| `PARENT` | Parent |
| `SPOU` | Spouse |
| `WIFE` | Wife; implies `SPOU` |
| `WITN` | Witness |
| `OTHER` | A role not listed here; should have a `PHRASE` substructure |

These should be interpreted in the context of the recoded event and its primary participant(s).
For example, if you cite a child’s birth record as the source of the mother’s name, the value for this field is “`MOTH`.”
If you describe the groom of a marriage, the role is “`HUSB`.”

> **Question**: Are there other roles we should add, like Lodger?

### `SEX`

| Value | Meaning                                     |
| ----- | :------------------------------------------ |
| `M`   | Male                                        |
| `F`   | Female                                      |
| `X`   | Intersex                                    |
| `U`   | Cannot be determined from available sources |

An individual’s biological or assigned sex.
Related concepts of gender identity, sexual preference, etc,
are not currently given their own tag but may be indicated using the `FACT` tag.


### `FAMC`.`STAT`

| Value | Meaning                        |
| ----- | :----------------------------- |
| `CHALLENGED` | Linking this child to this family is suspect, but the linkage has been neither proven nor disproven. |
| `DISPROVEN` | There has been a claim by some that this child belongs to this family, but the linkage has been disproven. |
| `PROVEN` | There has been a claim by some that this child does not belong to this family, but the linkage has been proven. |

> **Question**: What does "proven" mean?

### (LDS ordinance).`STAT`

These values were formerly used by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints for coordinating between temples and members.
They are no longer used in that way, meaning their interpretation in GEDCOM transmissions is subject to individual user interpretation

| Value | Meaning                             |
| ----- | :---------------------------------- |
| `BIC` | Born in the covenant, receiving blessing of child to parent sealing. |
| `CANCELED` | Canceled and considered invalid. |
| `CHILD` | Died before eight years old. |
| `COMPLETED` | Completed, but the date is not known. |
| `EXCLUDED` | Patron excluded this ordinance from being cleared in this submission. |
| `DNS` | This ordinance is not authorized. |
| `DNS_CAN` | This ordinance is not authorized, and the previous ordinance is cancelled. |
| `INFANT` | Died before less than one year old, baptism or endowment not required. |
| `PRE_1970` | Ordinance was likely completed because another ordinance for this person was converted from temple records of work completed before 1970. |
| `STILLBORN` | Stillborn, so ordinances not required. |
| `SUBMITTED` | Ordinance was previously submitted. |
| `UNCLEARED` | Data for clearing the ordinance request was insufficient. |

### `NAME`.`TYPE`

| Value | Meaning                       |
| ----- | :---------------------------- |
| `AKA` | Also known as, alias, etc. |
| `BIRTH` | Name given on birth certificate. |
| `IMMIGRANT` | Name assumed at the time of immigration. |
| `MAIDEN` | Maiden name, name before first marriage. |
| `MARRIED` | Name was person’s previous married name. |
| `NICK` | Descriptive or familiar used instead of a proper name (nickname/moniker). |
| `PROFESSIONAL` | Name used professionally (pen/screen/stage name). |
| `OTHER` | A name type not listed here; should have a `PHRASE` substructure |

# <a name="gedzip"></a> The GEDZIP file type 

It is often useful to transmit a GEDCOM document together with a set of external files.
The GEDZIP file format is provided for this purpose.

A GEDZIP file is a zip archive, as defined by <https://pkware.cachefly.net/webdocs/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT>
and standardized by [ISO/IEC 21320-1:2015](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=60101).
It contains the following files, none of which are inside zip folders (i.e., the entry names as stored in the ZIP archive do not include `/` characters, as described in 4.4.17 of `APPNOTE.TXT`):

- An entry with name `transmission.ged` containing a GEDCOM transmission

- An entry for each local-reference `FILE` structure in `transmission.ged`,
    with the same name as the corresponding `FILE` payload.

All file names inside a GEDZIP are case-sensitive.

> **Question**: Most file formats based on .zip (e.g. jar, epub, docx, GEDCOM-X etc) use a special index file that points to other files instead of a fixed primary file name. Should we do so also? e.g., GEDCOM-X has this:
>
> > The manifest is a REQUIRED entry in the GEDCOM X file that provides metadata about the GEDCOM X file and each of the resources contained within the file. The manifest is provided as an entry in the file named `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`.
> >
> > The metadata about the file and about each entry in the file is supplied in the manifest using "header fields" as defined by [RFC 822, Section 3.2](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc822#section-3.2). Each header field consists of a name followed by a colon (":") and the field value. Field names are case-insensitive. The field value MAY be preceded by any amount of linear white space, though a single space is RECOMMENDED. Header fields can be extended over multiple lines by preceding each extra line with at least one space character.
> >
> > Header fields are grouped into "sections". Sections are separated from other sections by one or more empty lines. The manifest consists of a "main" section followed by one section for each resource in the GEDCOM X file.

# <a name="A-calendar"></a> Appendix A: Known Calendars and Dates

## Known Calendars

GEDCOM 7 defines four calendars: `GREGORIAN`, `JULIAN`, `FRENCH_R`, and `HEBREW`.
Previous versions of GEDCOM also provided for, but did not define the meaning of, `ROMAN` and `UNKNOWN` calendars.

Extension calendars should use the usual rules for extensions, including using `_` as the leading character of the calendar name. Month codes must not start with `_`, even in extension calendars.

### `GREGORIAN`
    
The Gregorian calendar is the now-ubiquitous calendar introduced by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582 to correct the Julian calendar which was slowly drifting relative to the seasons. 

Permitted months are

|Code   |Name       |
|:------|:----------|
| `JAN` | January   |
| `FEB` | February  |
| `MAR` | March     |
| `APR` | April     |
| `MAY` | May       |
| `JUN` | June      |
| `JUL` | July      |
| `AUG` | August    |
| `SEP` | September |
| `OCT` | October   |
| `NOV` | November  |
| `DEC` | December  |

The epoch marker `BCE` is permitted in this calendar;
year *y* BCE indicates a year *y* years before year 1.
Thus, there is no year 0; year 1 BCE was followed by year 1.
    
### `JULIAN`
    
The Julian calendar was introduced by Julius Caesar in 45 BC and subsequently amended by Augustus in about 8 BC to correct an error in the application of its leap year rule during its first three decades. Years were been counted from various starting epochs during the Julian calendar's use; the version standardized by GEDCOM uses the same starting epoch as the Gregorian calendar.

This calendar uses the same months as the Gregorian calendar, differing only in which years February has 29 days.

The epoch marker `BCE` is permitted in this calendar;
year *y* BCE indicates a year *y* years before year 1.
Thus, there is no year 0; year 1 BCE was followed by year 1.

### `FRENCH_R`
    
The French Republican calendar or French Revolutionary calendar are the names given to the new calendar adopted in 1794 by the French National Convention. This calendar was adopted on Gregorian day 22 September 1792, which was 1 Vendémiaire 1 in this calendar. It was abandoned 18 years later.

Permitted months are

|Code  |Name               |
|:-----|:------------------|
|`VEND`|Vendemiaire        |
|`BRUM`|Brumaire           |
|`FRIM`|Frimaire           |
|`NIVO`|Nivose             |
|`PLUV`|Pluviose           |
|`VENT`|Ventose            |
|`GERM`|Germinal           |
|`FLOR`|Floreal            |
|`PRAI`|Prairial           |
|`MESS`|Messidor           |
|`THER`|Thermidor          |
|`FRUC`|Fructidor          |
|`COMP`|Jour Complementairs|

No epoch marker is permitted in this calendar.

### `HEBREW`
    
The Hebrew calendar is the name given to the calendar used by Jewish peoples around the world which developed into its current form in the early ninth century. It traditionally marks new days at sunset, not midnight. Its first day (1 Tishrei 1) primarily overlapped with Gregorian 7 September 3761 BCE and Julian 7 October 3761 BCE (starting at sunset on the 6th day of those months).

|Code | Name                                                   |
|:----|:-------------------------------------------------------|
|`TSH`| Tishrei (תִּשְׁרֵי) |
|`CSH`| Marcheshvan (מַרְחֶשְׁוָן) or Cheshvan (חֶשְׁוָן) |
|`KSL`| Kislev (כִּסְלֵו) |
|`TVT`| Tevet (טֵבֵת) |
|`SHV`| Shevat (שְׁבָט) |
|`ADR`| Adar I, Adar Rishon, First Adar, or Adar Aleph (אדר א׳) |
|`ADS`| Adar (אֲדָר); or Adar II, Adar Sheni, Second Adar, or Adar Bet (אדר ב׳) |
|`NSN`| Nisan (נִיסָן) |
|`IYR`| Iyar (אִייָר) |
|`SVN`| Sivan (סִיוָן) |
|`TMZ`| Tammuz (תַּמּוּז) |
|`AAV`| Av (אָב) |
|`ELL`| Elul (אֱלוּל) |

To keep the lunar-based months synchronized with the solar-based years, some years have Adar I and others do not, instead proceeding from Shevat directly to Adar II. However, in common (non-leap) years, it is common to simply write "Adar" not "Adar II", which users not aware of the distinction might incorrectly encode as `ADR` instead of `ADS`. It is recommended that systems knowing which years had Adar I and which did not replace `ADR` in common years with `ADS`.

No epoch marker is permitted in this calendar.


## Dual dates

The day on which a new year began and the year number increased varied at different times and places during the use of the Gregorian and Julian calendars. For example, England measured the new year as 25 March until 1752, which it switched to 1 January. In periods of transition, or when writing after a change about dates occurring before a change, it was sometimes common to indicate two years with a slash, as e.g. "30 January 1648/49" meaning "1648 if you count new year as coming after 30 January, 1649 if you count it as coming before 30 January". Other notations, such as abbreviations for phrases like "new style" and "old style", were also sometimes employed.

```gedcom
2 DATE 30 JAN 1649
3 PHRASE 30 January 1648/49
```

Many nations transitioned from using the Julian calendar to using the Gregorian calendar. This transition caused a change in dates by several days, which (depending on the date in question) could change the month and year as well. In periods of transition, or when writing after a change about dates occurring before a change, it was sometimes common to indicate two dates with slashes, as e.g. "23/6 November/December 1907" meaning "Julian 23 November 1907, Gregorian 6 December 1907". Other notations, such as abbreviations for phrases like "new style" and "old style", were also sometimes employed.

```gedcom
2 DATE 6 DEC 1907
3 PHRASE 23/6 November/December 1907
```

Some documents also used slashed to indicate approximate dates, such as writing a birth year as "1903/4" when it was computed from a year-granularity age at a given date.

```gedcom
2 DATE BET 1903 AND 1904
3 PHRASE 1903/4
```


GEDCOM 5.3 through 5.5.1 had special syntax for recording the first of these three concepts with a slash in the year. However, because slashes appear in historical documents with all three of the above meanings, some users misused this notation to record the other two situations as well. The result is ambiguity in the intended meaning of the resulting data.

GEDCOM 7.0 removed the year slash notation; a `PHRASE` substructure should be used instead to clarify meaning.


## Calendars in date ranges and date periods

Calendars apply to the subsequent `date` production, not to the entire `DateValue`.
Hence,

- `DATE FROM 1670 TO 1800` means `DATE FROM GREGORIAN 1670 TO GREGORIAN 1800`
- `DATE FROM 1670 TO JULIAN 1800` means `DATE FROM GREGORIAN 1670 TO JULIAN 1800`
- `DATE FROM JULIAN 1670 TO 1800` means `DATE FROM JULIAN 1670 TO GREGORIAN 1800`

Because some systems may show dates as-is to users and not all users understand the above rule, it is *recommended* that `calendar` tags be included if any `date` is non-`GREGORIAN`. It is *recommended* that the `calendar` tag be omitted if all `date`s in a payload are in the Gregorian calendar. Hence, the recommended forms of the previous three dates are

- `DATE FROM 1670 TO 1800`
- `DATE FROM GREGORIAN 1670 TO JULIAN 1800`
- `DATE FROM JULIAN 1670 TO GREGORIAN 1800`
